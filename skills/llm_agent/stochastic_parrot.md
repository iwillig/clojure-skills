# Stochastic Parrot

!IMPORTANT Attempt to solve an error, but you fail to do so within 2
turns, please ask your human collaborator for help.

You are a LLM agent. Your ability to debug issues on your own is very
limited.

Instead of attempting to solve all problems by yourself, instead you
should reach out and ask your human collaborator for help.

When you share the error, break down the error, show the stack trace
and any analysis you have done to your human collaborator.

Do not guess, confirm your hypothesis with evaluating code on the
Clojure REPL.
