# Clojure Style Guide Documentation Project

## Overview

This plan breaks down the [bbatsov/clojure-style-guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide) into modular, reusable skill documents for the clojure-skills repository. Each skill will be a standalone markdown file that can be composed into larger prompts.

**IMPORTANT: Citation Requirement**

All skills created under this plan MUST include proper attribution to the original source:

- **Primary Source**: https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide
- **Author**: Bozhidar Batsov and contributors
- **License**: Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License

Each skill should include a citation in its Resources section:

```markdown
## Resources

- [Clojure Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide) - Original style guide by Bozhidar Batsov
- [Clojure Community Style Guide](https://guide.clojure.style) - Web version
```

## Alignment with Existing Skills

### Already Covered (DO NOT DUPLICATE)

The following areas are already well-covered by existing skills:

1. **Code Formatting Tools** (tooling/cljstyle.md)
   - Covers automated formatting rules
   - Indentation, whitespace, namespace formatting
   - Configuration and usage of cljstyle

2. **Linting and Static Analysis** (tooling/clj_kondo.md)
   - Code quality checks
   - Common anti-patterns

3. **Parentheses/Delimiter Management** (tooling/clj_paren_repair.md)
   - Delimiter repair and balancing

4. **REPL and Development Workflow** (language/clojure_repl.md, clojure_mcp/clojure_eval.md)
   - Interactive development patterns
   - REPL-driven development

### Focus Areas for New Skills

These skills should focus on **human understanding and best practices** rather than tool automation:

1. **Code Layout Principles** - *Why* code is formatted certain ways
2. **Naming Conventions** - Community standards for names
3. **Idiomatic Patterns** - The "Clojure way" of writing code
4. **Documentation Practices** - Comments, docstrings, metadata
5. **Organization Patterns** - How to structure code and projects

### Integration Strategy

New skills should:
- Reference existing tool skills where appropriate
- Focus on the reasoning and principles behind conventions
- Provide examples that illustrate best practices
- Avoid duplicating automated formatting rules (those belong in cljstyle skill)
- Complement existing skills by explaining *why* certain patterns exist

## Project Goals

1. **Make style guide knowledge searchable** - Each skill can be found via clojure-skills search
2. **Enable composition** - Skills can be mixed into agent prompts as needed
3. **Maintain single responsibility** - Each skill covers one cohesive topic
4. **Cite original source** - Proper attribution to bbatsov/clojure-style-guide
5. **Complement existing skills** - Don't duplicate cljstyle, clj-kondo, etc.

## Target Audience

- LLM agents working with Clojure codebases
- Developers learning Clojure conventions
- Teams establishing coding standards

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All skills properly cite the original style guide
- [ ] No duplication with existing tooling skills (cljstyle, clj-kondo, etc.)
- [ ] Skills focus on principles and reasoning, not just rules
- [ ] Each skill is independently useful and searchable
- [ ] Skills integrate well with existing language and tooling skills
- [ ] Examples demonstrate idiomatic Clojure patterns
